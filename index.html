But did you ever stop and think about how and why it's done this way? Let's talk about the best approach for our needs and the 'old school' methods to set everything in place.</span></div></li><li class="talk"><span class="talk__time">19:15</span> <img class="talk__speaker" src="assets/images/bogdan-01.png"><div class="talk__info"><p class="talk__title">How to build a modern app in minutes <span>by Bogdan C.</span></p><span class="talk__description">Have you ever dived into making modern, offline-friendly, performant JavaScript applications with the simplest setup possible for your next project?<br>If so, you have come to the right place!</span></div></li><li class="talk"><span class="talk__time">19:45</span> <img class="talk__speaker" src="assets/images/beer.png"><div class="talk__info"><p class="talk__title">Short drinks break</p><span class="talk__description">You made it so far, you deserve a short break.

While it does sound great, you probably have no idea what it actually means. Don’t worry, neither did I, when I first read it. As a JavaScript developer moving towards TypeScript, I wanted to harness the entire strength of the language, while also avoiding the common pitfalls. In this session, I will talk about what I learned throughout the process and how this transition improved our codebase, our reliability and, ultimately, our working velocity (or coffee breaks per day).</span></div></li><li class="talk"><span class="talk__time">20:35</span> <img class="talk__speaker" src="assets/images/mihai-01.png"><div class="talk__info"><p class="talk__title">The performance mindset <span>by Mihai B.</span></p><span class="talk__description">Your JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Java, Go, Python, C++, Pascal, SQL, C#, F#, J#, you-name-it, code is as good as your customers say it is.
